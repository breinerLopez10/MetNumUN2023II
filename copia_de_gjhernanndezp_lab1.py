# Colab Yahoo Introduction to the Research Environment

The research environment is powered by IPython notebooks, which allow one to perform a great deal of data analysis and statistical validation. We'll demonstrate a few simple techniques here.

##Code Cells vs. Text Cells

As you can see, each cell can be either code or text. To select between them, choose from the 'Cell Type' dropdown menu on the top left.

##Executing a Command

A code cell will be evaluated when you press play, or when you press the shortcut, shift-enter. Evaluating a cell evaluates each line of code in sequence, and prints the results of the last line below the cell.
"""

"""**My own example 1**"""

3 + 53

"""Sometimes there is no result to be printed, as is the case with assignment."""

X = 2

"""**My own example 2**"""

Y = 73

"""Remember that only the result from the last line is printed."""

2 + 2
3 + 3

"""**My own example 3**"""

2 + 5
3 + 83

"""However, you can print whichever lines you want using the `print` statement."""

print(2 + 2)

"""##Knowing When a Cell is Running

*   Elemento de la lista



While a cell is running, a `[*]` will display on the left. When a cell has yet to be executed, `[ ]` will display. When it has been run, a number will display indicating the order in which it was run during the execution of the notebook `[5]`. Try on this cell and note it happening.

"""##Importing Libraries

The vast majority of the time, you'll want to use functions from pre-built libraries. You can't import every library on Quantopian due to security issues, but you can import most of the common scientific ones. Here I import numpy and pandas, the two most common and useful libraries in quant finance. I recommend copying this import statement to every new notebook.

Notice that you can rename libraries to whatever you want after importing. The `as` statement allows this. Here we use `np` and `pd` as aliases for `numpy` and `pandas`. This is a very common aliasing and will be found in most code snippets around the web. The point behind this is to allow you to type fewer characters when you are frequently accessing these libraries.
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# This is a plotting library for pretty pictures.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



"""##Tab Autocomplete

Pressing tab will give you a list of IPython's best guesses for what you might want to type next. This is incredibly valuable and will save you a lot of time. If there is only one possible option for what you could type next, IPython will fill that in for you. Try pressing tab very frequently, it will seldom fill in anything you don't want, as if there is ambiguity a list will be shown. This is a great way to see what functions are available in a library.

Try placing your cursor after the `.` and pressing tab.
"""

import math



"""##Getting Documentation Help

Placing a question mark after a function and executing that line of code will give you the documentation IPython has for that function. It's often best to do this in a new cell, as you avoid re-executing other code and running into bugs.

# Introduction to Python
by Maxwell Margenot

Part of the Quantopian Lecture Series:

* [www.quantopian.com/lectures](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures)
* [github.com/quantopian/research_public](https://github.com/quantopian/research_public)


---

All of the coding that you will do on the Quantopian platform will be in Python. It is also just a good, jack-of-all-trades language to know! Here we will provide you with the basics so that you can feel confident going through our other lectures and understanding what is happening.

## Code Comments

A comment is a note made by a programmer in the source code of a program. Its purpose is to clarify the source code and make it easier for people to follow along with what is happening. Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`). Including a `#` in a line of code will comment out anything that follows it.
"""

# This is a comment
# These lines of code will not change any values
# Anything following the first # is not run as code

"""**my own example 14**"""

## Esto es un comentario <3

"""You may hear text enclosed in triple quotes (`''' Insert Text Here '''`) referred to as multi-line comments, but this is not entirely accurate. This is a special type of `string` (a data type we will cover), called a `docstring`, used to explain the purpose of a function.

This is a special string

**my own expample 15**

Uno especial xd

Make sure you read the comments within each code cell (if they are there). They will provide more real-time explanations of what is going on as you look at each line of code.

## Variables

Variables provide names for values in programming. If you want to save a value for later or repeated use, you give the value a name, storing the contents in a variable. Variables in programming work in a fundamentally similar way to variables in algebra, but in Python they can take on various different data types.

The basic variable types that we will cover in this section are `integers`, `floating point numbers`, `booleans`, and `strings`.

An `integer` in programming is the same as in mathematics, a round number with no values after the decimal point. We use the built-in `print` function here to display the values of our variables as well as their types!
"""

my_integer = 50
print(my_integer, type(my_integer))

"""**my own example 16**"""

entero = 103
print(entero, type(entero))

"""Variables, regardless of type, are assigned by using a single equals sign (`=`). Variables are case-sensitive so any changes in variation in the capitals of a variable name will reference a different variable entirely."""

one =1
print(One)

"""A `floating point` number, or a `float` is a fancy name for a real number (again as in mathematics). To define a `float`, we need to either include a decimal point or specify that the value is a float."""

my_float = 1.0
print(my_float, type(my_float))
my_float = float(1)
print(my_float, type(my_float))

"""**my own example 17**"""

my_float1 = 2.1
print(my_float1, type(my_float1))
my_float1 = float(1)
print(my_float1, type(my_float1))

"""A variable of type `float` will not round the number that you store in it, while a variable of type `integer` will. This makes `floats` more suitable for mathematical calculations where you want more than just integers.

Note that as we used the `float()` function to force an number to be considered a `float`, we can use the `int()` function to force a number to be considered an `int`.

my_int = int(3.14159)
print(my_int, type(my_int))

"""**my own example 18**"""

int = int(3.2123123)
print(int, type(int))

"""The `int()` function will also truncate any digits that a number may have after the decimal point!

Strings allow you to include text as a variable to operate on. They are defined using either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
"""

my_string = 'This is a string with single quotes'
print(my_string)
my_string = "This is a string with double quotes"
print(my_string)

"""**my own example 19**"""

print(my_string)

"""**my own example 20**"""

my_string = '"Doble adentro'
print(my_string)
my_string = "'Doble afuera"
print(my_string)

"""Booleans, or `bools` are binary variable types. A `bool` can only take on one of two values, these being `True` or `False`. There is much more to this idea of truth values when it comes to programming, which we cover later in the [Logical Operators](#id-section5) of this notebook."""

my_bool = True
print(my_bool, type(my_bool))

"""There are many more data types that you can assign as variables in Python, but these are the basic ones! We will cover a few more later as we move through this tutorial.

## Basic Math

Python has a number of built-in math functions. These can be extended even further by importing the **math** package or by including any number of other calculation-based packages.

All of the basic arithmetic operations are supported: `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`. You can create exponents by using `**` and modular arithmetic is introduced with the mod operator, `%`.

The `round()` function will round a number to a specified number of the decimal points (the default is $0$). Calling `max()` or `min()` on a collection of numbers will return, respectively, the maximum or minimum value in the collection. Calling `sum()` on a collection of numbers will add them all up. If you're not familiar with how collections of values in Python work, don't worry! We will cover collections in-depth in the next section.

Additional math functionality can be added in with the `math` package.

### Dictionaries

Another essential data structure in Python is the dictionary. Dictionaries are defined with a combination of curly braces (`{}`) and colons (`:`). The braces define the beginning and end of a dictionary and the colons indicate key-value pairs. A dictionary is essentially a set of key-value pairs. The key of any entry must be an immutable data type. This makes both strings and tuples candidates. Keys can be both added and deleted.

In the following example, we have a dictionary composed of key-value pairs where the key is a genre of fiction (`string`) and the value is a list of books (`list`) within that genre. Since a collection is still considered a single entity, we can use one to collect multiple variables or values into one key-value pair.

## Logical Operators
### Basic Logic

Logical operators deal with `boolean` values, as we briefly covered before. If you recall, a `bool` takes on one of two values, `True` or `False` (or $1$ or $0$). The basic logical statements that we can make are defined using the built-in comparators. These are `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).
"""

print(5 == 5)

print(5 > 5)

"""**my own example  66**"""

print(4>4)

"""These comparators also work in conjunction with variables."""

m = 2
n = 23
print(m < n)

"""**my own example  67**"""

x=5
y=2
print(x>y)

"""We can string these comparators together to make more complex logical statements using the logical operators `or`, `and`, and `not`."""

print("Statement 1 truth value: {0}".format(statement_1))

"""**my own example 68**"""

statement_1 = 1 > 5
statement_2 = 6 <= 5
print("Statement 1 truth value: {0}".format(statement_1))
print("Statement 2 truth value: {0}".format(statement_2))
print("Statement 1 and Statement 2: {0}".format(statement_1 and statement_2))

"""The `or` operator performs a logical `or` calculation. This is an inclusive `or`, so if either component paired together by `or` is `True`, the whole statement will be `True`. The `and` statement only outputs `True` if all components that are `and`ed together are True. Otherwise it will output `False`. The `not` statement simply inverts the truth value of whichever statement follows it. So a `True` statement will be evaluated as `False` when a `not` is placed in front of it. Similarly, a `False` statement will become `True` when a `not` is in front of it.

Say that we have two logical statements, or assertions, $P$ and $Q$. The truth table for the basic logical operators is as follows:

|  P  |  Q  | `not` P| P `and` Q | P `or` Q|
|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `True` | `True` | `False` | `True` | `True` |
| `False` | `True` | `True` | `False` | `True` |
| `True` | `False` | `False` | `False` | `True` |
| `False` | `False` | `True` | `False` | `False` |

We can string multiple logical statements together using the logical operators.

"""Logical statements can be as simple or complex as we like, depending on what we need to express. Evaluating the above logical statement step by step we see that we are evaluating (`True and True`) `or` (`False and not False`). This becomes `True or (False and True`), subsequently becoming `True or False`, ultimately being evaluated as `True`.

#### Truthiness

Data types in Python have a fun characteristic called truthiness. What this means is that most built-in types will evaluate as either `True` or `False` when a boolean value is needed (such as with an if-statement). As a general rule, containers like strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and sets, will return `True` if they contain anything at all and `False` if they contain nothing.

"""And so on, for the other collections and containers. `None` also evaluates as `False`. The number `1` is equivalent to `True` and the number `0` is equivalent to `False` as well, in a boolean context.

### If-statements

We can create segments of code that only execute if a set of conditions is met. We use if-statements in conjunction with logical statements in order to create branches in our code.

An `if` block gets entered when the condition is considered to be `True`. If condition is evaluated as `False`, the `if` block will simply be skipped unless there is an `else` block to accompany it. Conditions are made using either logical operators or by using the truthiness of values in Python. An if-statement is defined with a colon and a block of indented text.

## Loop Structures

Loop structures are one of the most important parts of programming. The `for` loop and the `while` loop provide a way to repeatedly run a block of code repeatedly. A `while` loop will iterate until a certain condition has been met. If at any point after an iteration that condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. A `for` loop will iterate over a sequence of values and terminate when the sequence has ended. You can instead include conditions within the `for` loop to decide whether it should terminate early or you could simply let it run its course.

In this case, we use the shorthand `i -= 1` (short for `i = i - 1`) so that the value of `i` gets smaller with each iteration. Eventually `i` will be reduced to `0`, rendering the condition `False` and exiting the loop.

A `for` loop iterates a set number of times, determined when you state the entry into the loop. In this case we are iterating over the list returned from `range()`. The `for` loop selects a value from the list, in order, and temporarily assigns the value of `i` to it so that operations can be performed with the value.

This was a lot of material and there is still even more to cover! Make sure you play around with the cells in each notebook to accustom yourself to the syntax featured here and to figure out any limitations. If you want to delve even deeper into the material, the [documentation for Python](https://docs.python.org/2/) is all available online. We are in the process of developing a second part to this Python tutorial, designed to provide you with even more programming knowledge, so keep an eye on the [Quantopian Lectures Page](quantopian.com/lectures) and the [forums](quantopian.com/posts) for any new lectures.

These objects have a strong integration with NumPy, covered elsewhere in the [lecture series](http://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-NumPy), allowing us to easily do the necessary statistical and mathematical calculations that we need for finance.

If we resample our `Series`, we can adjust the frequency of our data. We currently have daily data (excluding weekends) because `get_pricing()` pulls only data from market days. Let's up-sample from this daily data to monthly data using the `resample()` method.

We will take care of these `NaN` values in the next section, when we deal with missing data.

#### Missing Data

Whenever we deal with real data, there is a very real possibility of encountering missing values. Real data is riddled with holes and pandas provides us with ways to handle them. Sometimes resampling or reindexing can create `NaN` values. Fortunately, pandas provides us with ways to handle them. We have two primary means of coping with missing data. The first of these is filling in the missing data with  `fillna()`. For example, say that we want to fill in the missing days with the mean price of all days.
"""

meanfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(calendar_prices.mean())
meanfilled_prices.head(10)

"""Using `fillna()` is fairly easy. It is just a matter of indicating the value that you want to fill the spaces with. Unfortunately, this particular case doesn't make a whole lot of sense, for reasons discussed in the [lecture on stationarity](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity) in the Lecture series. We could fill them with with $0$, simply, but that's similarly uninformative.

Rather than filling in specific values, we can use the `method` parameter, similarly to how the `reindex()` method works. We could use "backward fill", where `NaN`s are filled with the *next* filled value (instead of forward fill's *last* filled value) like so:
"""

bfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(method='bfill')
bfilled_prices.head(10)

"""But again, this is a bad idea for the same reasons as the previous option. Both of these so-called solutions take into account *future data* that was not available at the time of the data points that we are trying to fill. In the case of using the mean or the median, these summary statistics are calculated by taking into account the entire time series. Backward filling is equivalent to saying that the price of a particular security today, right now, tomorrow's price. This also makes no sense. These two options are both examples of look-ahead bias, using data that would be unknown or unavailable at the desired time, and should be avoided.

Our next option is significantly more appealing. We could simply drop the missing data using the `dropna()` method. This is much better alternative than filling `NaN` values in with arbitrary numbers.

dropped_prices = calendar_prices.dropna()

### `DataFrames`

Many of the aspects of working with `Series` carry over into `DataFrames`. pandas `DataFrames` allow us to easily manage our data with their intuitive structure.

Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.

We can create a `DataFrame` by calling `pandas.DataFrame()` on a dictionary or NumPy `ndarray`. We can also concatenate a group of pandas `Series` into a `DataFrame` using `pandas.concat()`.

# Logical Operations and Loops

# Introduction
We discussed the basic data types and data structures in Python in the last tutorial. This chapter covers logical operations and loops in Python, which are very common in programming.

# Logical Operations
Like most programming languages, Python has comparison operators:
"""

print(1 == 0)
print(1 == 1)

print(3 == 1)
print(2 != 0)
print(4 >= 2)
print(5 >= 1)

"""**my own example 164**"""

print(1 == 1)
print(2 == 2)
print(5 != 0)
print(5 >= 5)
print(5 >= 5)

"""Each statement above has a boolean value, which must be either True or False, but not both.

We can combine simple statements P and Q to form complex statements using logical operators:

- The statement "P and Q" is true if both P and Q are true, otherwise it is false.
- The statement "P or Q" is false if both P and Q are false, otherwise it is true.
- The statement "not P" is true if P is false, and vice versa.
"""

print(3 > 1 and 3 > 2)
print(3 > 1 and 3 < 2)

An if statement executes a segment of code only if its condition is true. A standard if statement consists of 3 segments: if, elif and else.

```python

else:

A function is a reusable block of code. We can use a function to output a value, or do anything else we want. We can easily define our own function by using the keyword "def".

"""# Object-Oriented Programming
Python is an object-oriented programming language. It's important to understand the concept of "objects" because almost every kind of data from QuantConnect API is an object.

## Class
A class is a type of data, just like a string, float, or list. When we create an object of that data type, we call it an instance of a class.

In Python, everything is an object - everything is an instance of some class. The data stored inside an object are called attributes, and the functions which are associated with the object are called methods.

For example, as mentioned above, a list is an object of the "list" class, and it has a method list.sort().

We can create our own objects by defining a class. We would do this when it's helpful to group certain functions together. For example, we define a class named "Stock" here:
"""

class stock:
    def __init__(self, ticker, open, close, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.volume = volume
        self.rate_return = float(close)/open - 1

    def update(self, open, close):
        self.open = open
        self.close = close
        self.rate_return = float(self.close)/self.open - 1

    def print_return(self):
        print(self.rate_return)

"""The "Stock" class has attributes "ticker", "open", "close", "volume" and "rate_return". Inside the class body, the first method is called __init__, which is a special method. When we create a new instance of the class, the __init__ method is immediately executed with all the parameters that we pass to the "Stock" object. The purpose of this method is to set up a new "Stock" object using data we have provided.

Here we create two Stock objects named "apple" and "google".
"""

apple = stock('AAPL', 143.69, 144.09, 20109375)
google = stock('GOOG', 898.7, 911.7, 1561616)

"""**my own example 192**"""

apple = stock('TSLA', 1,2032,123123123)
google = stock('GOOG', 1,4, 12312)

"""**my own example 193**"""

apple = stock('AAPL', 24422,1232,147)
google = stock('GOOG', 234978,24,7499)

apple.ticker
google.print_return()
google.update(912.8,913.4)
google.print_return()

"""By calling the update() function, we updated the open and close prices of a stock. Please note that when we use the attributes or call the methods **inside a class**, we need to specify them as self.attribute or self.method(), otherwise Python will deem them as global variables and thus raise an error.

We can add an attribute to an object anywhere:
"""

apple.ceo = 'Tim Cook'
apple.ceo

"""**my own example 194**"""

FB.ceo = 'mark zuckenberg'
FB.ceo

"""**my own example 195**"""

amazon.ceo = 'Andy Jassy'
amazon.ceo

"""We can check what names (i.e. attributes and methods) are defined on an object using the dir() function:"""

dir(apple)

"""## Inheritance
Inheritance is a way of arranging classes in a hierarchy from the most general to the most specific. A "child" class is a more specific type of a "parent" class because a child class will inherit all the attribues and methods of its parent. For example, we define a class named "Child" which inherits "Stock":
"""

class child(stock):
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

aa = child('aa')
print(aa.name)
aa.update(100,102)
print(aa.open)
print(aa.close)
print(aa.print_return())

"""As seen above, the new class Child has inherited the methods from Stock.

#Summary

In this chapter we have introduced functions and classes. When we write a QuantConnect algorithm, we would define our algorithm as a class (QCAlgorithm). This means our algorithm inherited the QC API methods from QCAlgorithm class.

In the next chapter, we will introduce NumPy and Pandas, which enable us to conduct scientific calculations in Python.

"""We have to rescale the weights so that they all add up to $1$. We do this by scaling the weights vector by the sum total of all the weights. This step ensures that we will be using $100\%$ of the portfolio's cash.

To calculate the mean return of the portfolio, we have to scale each asset's return by its designated weight. We can pull each element of each array and multiply them individually, but it's quicker to use NumPy's linear algebra methods. The function that we want is `dot()`. This will calculate the dot product between two arrays for us. So if $v = \left[ 1, 2, 3 \right]$ and $w = \left[4, 5, 6 \right]$, then:

$$ v \cdot w = 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 5 + 3 \times 6 $$

For a one-dimensional vector, the dot product will multiply each element pointwise and add all the products together! In our case, we have a vector of weights, $\omega = \left[ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots \omega_N\right]$ and a vector of returns, $\mu = \left[ \mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_N\right]$. If we take the dot product of these two we will get:

$$ \omega \cdot \mu = \omega_1\mu_1 + \omega_2\mu_2 + \dots + \omega_N\mu_N = \mu_P $$

This yields the sum of all the asset returns scaled by their respective weights. This the the portfolio's overall expected return!
"""

p_returns = np.dot(weights, mean_returns)
print "Expected return of the portfolio: ", p_returns

"""Calculating the mean return is fairly intuitive and does not require too much explanation of linear algebra. However, calculating the variance of our portfolio requires a bit more background.

#### Beware of NaN values

Most of the time, all of these calculations will work without an issue. However, when working with real data we run the risk of having `nan` values in our arrays. This is NumPy's way of saying that the data there is missing or doesn't exist. These `nan` values can lead to errors in mathematical calculations so it is important to be aware of whether your array contains `nan` values and to know how to drop them.

If we use a boolean array to index an array, we will remove all values of the array that register as `False` under the condition.

These indeterminate values are more an issue with data than linear algebra itself so it is helpful that there are ways to handle them.

### Conclusion

Linear algebra is pervasive in finance and in general. For example, the calculation of *optimal* weights according to modern portfolio theory is done using linear algebra techniques. The arrays and functions in NumPy allow us to handle these calculations in an intuitive way. For a quick intro to linear algebra and how to use NumPy to do more significant matrix calculations, proceed to the next section.

## A brief foray into linear algebra

Let's start with a basic overview of some linear algebra. Linear algebra comes down to the multiplication and composition of scalar and matrix values. A scalar value is just a real number that we multiply against an array. When we scale a matrix or array using a scalar, we multiply each individual element of that matrix or array by the scalar.

A matrix is a collection of values, typically represented by an $m \times n$ grid, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The edge lengths $m$ and $n$ do not necessarily have to be different. If we have $m = n$, we call this a square matrix. A particularly interesting case of a matrix is when $m = 1$ or $n = 1$. In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$. For the purpose of this section, we will be using matrix and array interchangeably.

We can express the matrix equation as:

$$ y = A\cdot x $$

Where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $y$ is a $m \times 1$ vector, and $x$ is a $n \times 1$ vector. On the right-hand side of the equation we are multiplying a matrix by a vector. This requires a little bit more clarification, lest we think that we can go about multiplying any matrices by any other matrices.

#### Matrix multiplication

With matrix multiplication, the order in which the matrices are multiplied matters. Multiplying a matrix on the left side by another matrix may be just fine, but multiplying on the right may be undefined.
"""

A = np.array([
        [1, 2, 3, 12, 6],

"""Notice that the above-defined matrices, $A$ and $B$, have different dimensions. $A$ is $3 \times 5$ and $B$ is $4 \times 3$. The general rule of what can and cannot be multiplied in which order is based on the dimensions of the matrices. Specifically, the number of columns in the matrix on the left must be equal to the number of rows in the matrix on the right. In super informal terms, let's say that we have an $m \times n$ matrix and a $p \times q$ matrix. If we multiply the first by the second on the right, we get the following:

$$ (m \times n) \cdot (p \times q) = (m \times q) $$

So the resultant product has the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix. This limitation of matrix multiplication with regards to dimensions is important to keep track of when writing code. To demonstrate this, we use the `dot()` function to multiply our matrices below:
"""

print np.dot(A, B)

"""These results make sense in accordance with our rule. Multiplying a $3 \times 5$ matrix on the right by a $4 \times 3$ matrix results in an error while multiplying a $4 \times 3$ matrix on the right by a $3 \times 5$ matrix results in a $4 \times 5$ matrix."""

print np.dot(B, A)

"""### Portfolio Variance

Let's return to our portfolio example from before. We calculated the expected return of the portfolio, but how do we calculate the variance? We start by trying to evaluate the portfolio as a sum of each individual asset, scaled by it's weight.

$$ VAR[P] = VAR[\omega_1 S_1 + \omega_2 S_2 + \cdots + \omega_N S_N] $$

Where $S_0, \cdots, S_N$ are the assets contained within our universe. If all of our assets were independent of each other, we could simply evaluate this as

$$ VAR[P] = VAR[\omega_1 S_1] + VAR[\omega_2 S_2] + \cdots + VAR[\omega_N S_N] = \omega_1^2\sigma_1^2 + \omega_2^2\sigma_2^2 + \cdots + \omega_N^2\sigma_N^2 $$

However, all of our assets depend on each other by their construction. They are all in some way related to our base asset and therefore each other. We thus have to calculate the variance of the portfolio by including the individual pairwise covariances of each asset. Our formula for the variance of the portfolio:

$$ VAR[P] = \sigma_P^2 = \sum_i \omega_i^2\sigma_i^2 + \sum_i\sum_{i\neq j} \omega_i\omega_j\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{i, j}, \ i, j \in \lbrace 1, 2, \cdots, N \rbrace $$

Where $\rho_{i,j}$ is the correlation between $S_i$ and $S_j$, $\rho_{i, j} = \frac{COV[S_i, S_j]}{\sigma_i\sigma_j}$. This seems exceedingly complicated, but we can easily handle all of this using NumPy arrays. First, we calculate the covariance matrix that relates all the individual stocks in our universe.
"""

cov_mat = np.cov(returns)
print cov_mat

"""This array is not formatted particularly nicely, but a covariance matrix is a very important concept. The covariance matrix is of the form:

$$ \left[\begin{matrix}
VAR[S_1] & COV[S_1, S_2] & \cdots & COV[S_1, S_N] \\
COV[S_2, S_1] & VAR[S_2] & \cdots & COV[S_2, S_N] \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
COV[S_N, S_1] & COV[S_N, S_2] & \cdots & VAR[S_N]
\end{matrix}\right] $$

So each diagonal entry is the variance of that asset at that index and each off-diagonal holds the covariance of two assets indexed by the column and row number. What is important is that once we have the covariance matrix we are able to do some very quick linear algebra to calculate the variance of the overall portfolio. We can represent the variance of the portfolio in array form as:

$$ \sigma_p^2 = \omega \ C \ \omega^\intercal$$

Where $C$ is the covariance matrix of all the assets and $\omega$ is the array containing the weights of each individual asset. The superscript $\intercal$ on the second $\omega$ listed above denotes the **transpose** of $\omega$. For a reference on the evaluation of the variance of a portfolio as a matrix equation, please see the Wikipedia article on [modern portfolio theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

The transpose of an array is what you get when you switch the rows and columns of an array. This has the effect of reflecting an array across what you might imagine as a diagonal. For example, take our array $A$ from before:
"""

print A

"""The transpose looks like a mirror image of the same array."""

print np.transpose(A)

"""But $\omega$ here is a 1-dimensional array, a vector! It makes perfect to take the transpose of $A$, a $3 \times 5$ array, as the output will be a $5 \times 3$ array, but a 1-dimensional array is not quite as intuitive. A typical 1-dimensional array can be thought of as a $1 \times n$ horizontal vector. Thus, taking the tranpose of this array essentially means changing it into a $n \times 1$ vertical vector. This makes sense because 1-dimensional arrays are still arrays and any multiplication done between 1-dimensional and higher dimensional arrays must keep in line with our dimensionality issue of matrix multiplication.

To make a long story short, we think of $\omega$ as $1 \times N$ since we have $N$ securities. This makes it so that $\omega^\intercal$ is $N \times 1$. Again, our covariance matrix is $N \times N$. So the overall multiplication works out like so, in informal terms:

$$ \text{Dimensions}(\sigma_p^2) = \text{Dimensions}(\omega C \omega^\intercal) = (1 \times N)\cdot (N \times N)\cdot (N \times 1) = (1 \times 1)$$

Multiplying the covariance matrix on the left by the plain horizontal vector and on the right by that vector's transpose results in the calculation of a single scalar ($1 \times 1$) value, our portfolio's variance.

So knowing this, let's proceed and calculate the portfolio variance! We can easily calculate the product of these arrays by using `dot()` for matrix multiplication, though this time we have to do it twice.
"""

# Calculating the portfolio volatility
var_p = np.dot(np.dot(weights, cov_mat), weights.T)
vol_p = np.sqrt(var_p)
print "Portfolio volatility: ", vol_p

"""To confirm this calculation, let's simply evaluate the volatility of the portfolio using only NumPy functions."""

# Confirming calculation
vol_p_alt = np.sqrt(np.var(np.dot(weights, returns), ddof=1))
print "Portfolio volatility: ", vol_p_alt

"""The `ddof` parameter is a simple integer input that tells the function the number of degrees of freedom to take into account. This is a more statistical concept, but what this tells us that our matrix calculation is correct!

A lot of this might not make sense at first glance. It helps to go back and forth between the theory and the code representations until you have a better grasp of the mathematics involved. It is definitely not necessary to be an expert on linear algebra and on matrix operations, but linear algebra can help to streamline the process of working with large amounts of data.

## pandas Data Structures

### `Series`

A pandas `Series` is a 1-dimensional array with labels that can contain any data type. We primarily use them for handling time series data. Creating a `Series` is as easy as calling `pandas.Series()` on a Python list or NumPy array.
"""

s = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])
print s

"""**my own example 215**"""

a = pd.Series([1, 3, np.nan, 1, 3, 3, 4,])
print (a)

"""Every `Series` has a name. We can give the series a name as a parameter or we can define it afterwards by directly accessing the name attribute. In this case, we have given our time series no name so the attribute should be empty."""

"""**my own example 216**"""

print (a.name)

"""This name can be directly modified with no repercussions."""

s.name = "Toy Series"
print s.name

"""**my own example 217**"""

a.name = "Tmy Series"
print (a.name)

"""**my own example 218**"""

a.name = "ya casiii"
print (a.name)

"""We call the collected axis labels of a `Series` its index. An index can either passed to a `Series` as a parameter or added later, similarly to its name. In the absence of an index, a `Series` will simply contain an index composed of integers, starting at $0$, as in the case of our "Toy Series"."""

print s.index

"""pandas has a built-in function specifically for creating date indices, `date_range()`. We use the function here to create a new index for `s`."""

new_index = pd.date_range("2016-01-01", periods=len(s), freq="D")

"""An index must be exactly the same length as the `Series` itself. Each index must match one-to-one with each element of the `Series`. Once this is satisfied, we can directly modify the `Series` index, as with the name, to use our new and more informative index (relatively speaking)."""

s.index = new_index
print s.index

"""The index of the `Series` is crucial for handling time series, which we will get into a little later.

#### Accessing `Series` Elements

`Series` are typically accessed using the `iloc[]` and `loc[]` methods. We use `iloc[]` to access elements by integer index and we use `loc[]` to access the index of the Series.
"""

print "First element of the series: ", s.iloc[0]
print "Last element of the series: ", s.iloc[len(s)-1]

"""**my own example 220**"""

"""When creating a slice, we have the options of specifying a beginning, an end, and a step. The slice will begin at the start index, and take steps of size `step` until it passes the end index, not including the end."""

start = 0
end = len(s) - 1
step = 1

s.iloc[start:end:step]

"""We can even reverse a `Series` by specifying a negative step size. Similarly, we can index the start and end with a negative integer value."""

s.iloc[::-1]

"""This returns a slice of the series that starts from the second to last element and ends at the third to last element (because the fourth to last is not included, taking steps of size $1$)."""

s.iloc[-2:-4:-1]

"""We can also access a series by using the values of its index. Since we indexed `s` with a collection of dates (`Timestamp` objects) we can look at the value contained in `s` for a particular date."""

s.loc['2016-01-01']

"""Or even for a range of dates!"""

s.loc['2016-01-02':'2016-01-04']

"""With `Series`, we *can* just use the brackets (`[]`) to access elements, but this is not best practice. The brackets are ambiguous because they can be used to access `Series` (and `DataFrames`) using both index and integer values and the results will change based on context (especially with `DataFrames`).

#### Boolean Indexing

In addition to the above-mentioned access methods, you can filter `Series` using boolean arrays. `Series` are compatible with your standard comparators. Once compared with whatever condition you like, you get back yet another `Series`, this time filled with boolean values.
"""

print s < 3

"""We can pass *this* `Series` back into the original `Series` to filter out only the elements for which our condition is `True`."""

print s.loc[(s < 3) & (s > 1)]

"""This is very convenient for getting only elements of a `Series` that fulfill specific criteria that we need. It gets even more convenient when we are handling `DataFrames`.

#### Indexing and Time Series

Since we use `Series` for handling time series, it's worth covering a little bit of how we handle the time component. For our purposes we use pandas `Timestamp` objects. Let's pull a full time series, complete with all the appropriate labels, by using our `get_pricing()` method. All data pulled with `get_pricing()` or using our Pipeline API will be in either `Series` or `DataFrame` format. We can modify this index however we like.

If we resample our `Series`, we can adjust the frequency of our data. We currently have daily data (excluding weekends) because `get_pricing()` pulls only data from market days. Let's up-sample from this daily data to monthly data using the `resample()` method.
"""

eastern_prices = prices.tz_convert('US/Eastern')
eastern_prices.head(10)

"""In addition to the capacity for timezone and frequency management, each time series has a built-in `reindex()` method that we can use to realign the existing data according to a new set of index labels. If data does not exist for a particular label, the data will be filled with a placeholder value. This is typically `np.nan`, though we can provide a fill method.

The data that we `get_pricing()` only includes market days. But what if we want prices for every single calendar day? This will include holidays and weekends, times when you normally cannot trade equities.  First let's create a new `DatetimeIndex` that contains all that we want.
"""

calendar_dates = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq='D', tz='UTC')
print calendar_dates

"""Now let's use this new set of dates to reindex our time series. We tell the function that the fill method that we want is `ffill`. This denotes "forward fill". Any `NaN` values will be filled by the *last value* listed. So the price on the weekend or on a holiday will be listed as the price on the last market day that we know about."""

calendar_prices = prices.reindex(calendar_dates, method='ffill')
calendar_prices.head(15)

"""You'll notice that we still have a couple of `NaN` values right at the beginning of our time series. This is because the first of January in 2012 was a Sunday and the second was a market holiday! Because these are the earliest data points and we don't have any information from before them, they cannot be forward-filled. We will take care of these `NaN` values in the next section, when we deal with missing data.

#### Missing Data

Whenever we deal with real data, there is a very real possibility of encountering missing values. Real data is riddled with holes and pandas provides us with ways to handle them. Sometimes resampling or reindexing can create `NaN` values. Fortunately, pandas provides us with ways to handle them. We have two primary means of coping with missing data. The first of these is filling in the missing data with  `fillna()`. For example, say that we want to fill in the missing days with the mean price of all days.
"""

meanfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(calendar_prices.mean())
meanfilled_prices.head(10)

"""Using `fillna()` is fairly easy. It is just a matter of indicating the value that you want to fill the spaces with. Unfortunately, this particular case doesn't make a whole lot of sense, for reasons discussed in the [lecture on stationarity](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity) in the Lecture series. We could fill them with with $0$, simply, but that's similarly uninformative.

Rather than filling in specific values, we can use the `method` parameter, similarly to how the `reindex()` method works. We could use "backward fill", where `NaN`s are filled with the *next* filled value (instead of forward fill's *last* filled value) like so:
"""

bfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(method='bfill')
bfilled_prices.head(10)

"""But again, this is a bad idea for the same reasons as the previous option. Both of these so-called solutions take into account *future data* that was not available at the time of the data points that we are trying to fill. In the case of using the mean or the median, these summary statistics are calculated by taking into account the entire time series. Backward filling is equivalent to saying that the price of a particular security today, right now, tomorrow's price. This also makes no sense. These two options are both examples of look-ahead bias, using data that would be unknown or unavailable at the desired time, and should be avoided.

Our next option is significantly more appealing. We could simply drop the missing data using the `dropna()` method. This is much better alternative than filling `NaN` values in with arbitrary numbers.
"""

dropped_prices = calendar_prices.dropna()
dropped_prices.head(10)

"""Now our time series is cleaned for the calendar year, with all of our `NaN` values properly handled. It is time to talk about how to actually do time series analysis with pandas data structures.

Make sure to check out the `Series` [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html) before resorting to other calculations of common functions.

### `DataFrames`

Many of the aspects of working with `Series` carry over into `DataFrames`. pandas `DataFrames` allow us to easily manage our data with their intuitive structure.

Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.

We can create a `DataFrame` by calling `pandas.DataFrame()` on a dictionary or NumPy `ndarray`. We can also concatenate a group of pandas `Series` into a `DataFrame` using `pandas.concat()`.
"""

    'a' : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'b' : ['L', 'K', 'J', 'M', 'Z'],
    'c' : np.random.normal(0, 1, 5)
}
print dict_data

"""Each `DataFrame` has a few key attributes that we need to keep in mind. The first of these is the index attribute. We can easily include an index of `Timestamp` objects like we did with `Series`."""

frame_data = pd.DataFrame(dict_data, index=pd.date_range('2016-01-01', periods=5))
print frame_data

"""As mentioned above, we can combine `Series` into `DataFrames`. Concatatenating `Series` like this will match elements up based on their corresponding index. As the following `Series` do not have an index assigned, they each default to an integer index."""

s_1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], name='Evens')
s_2 = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], name="Odds")
numbers = pd.concat([s_1, s_2], axis=1)
print numbers

"""We will use `pandas.concat()` again later to combine multiple `DataFrame`s into one.

Each `DataFrame` also has a `columns` attribute. These can either be assigned when we call `pandas.DataFrame` or they can be modified directly like the index. Note that when we concatenated the two `Series` above, the column names were the names of those `Series`.

"""Separate from the columns and index of a `DataFrame`, we can also directly access the values they contain by looking at the values attribute."""

numbers.values

"""This returns a NumPy array."""

Again we see a lot of carryover from `Series` in how we access the elements of `DataFrames`. The key sticking point here is that everything has to take into account multiple dimensions now. The main way that this happens is through the access of the columns of a `DataFrame`, either individually or in groups. We can do this either by directly accessing the attributes or by using the methods we already are familiar with.

print type(prices.loc[:, 'CMG'])

When you pass a 2-dimensional tuple into a `DataFrame`, the first element of the tuple is applied to the rows and the second is applied to the columns. So, to break it down, the above line of code tells the `DataFrame` to return every single row of the column with label `'CMG'`. Lists of columns are also supported."""

prices.loc[:, ['CMG', 'MCD']].head()

"""We can also simply access the `DataFrame` by index value using `loc[]`, as with `Series`."""

prices.loc['2015-12-15':'2015-12-22', ['CMG', 'MCD']]

"""Using `iloc[]` also works similarly, allowing you to access parts of the `DataFrame` by integer index."""

# Access prices with integer index in
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ..., 99]
# and in column 0 or 3

As with `Series`, sometimes we want to filter a `DataFrame` according to a set of criteria. We do this by indexing our `DataFrame` with boolean values.
"""

"""We can add multiple boolean conditions by using the logical operators `&`, `|`, and `~` (and, or, and not, respectively) again!"""

prices.loc[(prices.MCD > prices.WFM) & ~prices.SHAK.isnull()].head()

"""#### Adding, Removing Columns, Combining `DataFrames`/`Series`

It is all well and good when you already have a `DataFrame` filled with data, but it is also important to be able to add to the data that you have.

We add a new column simply by assigning data to a column that does not already exist. Here we use the `.loc[:, 'COL_NAME']` notation and store the output of `get_pricing()` (which returns a pandas `Series` if we only pass one security) there. This is the method that we would use to add a `Series` to an existing `DataFrame`.
"""

df_3 = pd.concat([df_1, df_2], axis=1)
df_3.head()

"""#### Missing data (again)
Bringing real-life data into a `DataFrame` brings us the same problems that we had with it in a `Series`, only this time in more dimensions. We have access to the same methods as with `Series`, as demonstrated below.
"""

filled0_prices = prices.fillna(0)
filled0_prices.head(5)

bfilled_prices = prices.fillna(method='bfill')
bfilled_prices.head(5)

"""But again, the best choice in this case (since we are still using time series data, handling multiple time series at once) is still to simply drop the missing values."""

dropped_prices = prices.dropna()
dropped_prices.head(5)

"""#### Time Series Analysis with pandas

Using the built-in statistics methods for `DataFrames`, we can perform calculations on multiple time series at once! The code to perform calculations on `DataFrames` here is almost exactly the same as the methods used for `Series` above, so don't worry about re-learning everything.

The `plot()` method makes another appearance here, this time with a built-in legend that corresponds to the names of the columns that you are plotting.

"""As well as the standard deviation:"""

prices.std(axis=0)

# NumPy and Basic Pandas

# Introduction

Now that we have introduced the fundamentals of Python, it's time to learn about NumPy and Pandas.

# NumPy
NumPy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It also has strong integration with Pandas, which is another powerful tool for manipulating financial data.

Python packages like NumPy and Pandas contain classes and methods which we can use by importing the package:
"""

import numpy as np

"""## Basic NumPy Arrays
A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. Here we make an array by passing a list of Apple stock prices:
"""

price_list = [143.73, 145.83, 143.68, 144.02, 143.5, 142.62]
price_array = np.array(price_list)
print(price_array, type(price_array))

"""Notice that the type of array is "ndarray" which is a multi-dimensional array. If we pass np.array() a list of lists, it will create a 2-dimensional array."""

Ar = np.array([[1,3],[2,4]])
print(Ar, type(Ar))

"""We get the dimensions of an ndarray using the .shape attribute:"""

print(Ar.shape)

"""If we create an 2-dimensional array (i.e. matrix), each row can be accessed by index:"""

print(Ar[0])
print(Ar[1])

"""If we want to access the matrix by column instead:"""

print('the first column: ', Ar[:,0])
print('the second column: ', Ar[:,1])

"""## Array Functions
Some functions built in NumPy that allow us to perform calculations on arrays. For example, we can apply the natural logarithm to each element of an array:
"""

print(np.log(price_array))

"""Other functions return a single value:"""

print(np.mean(price_array))
print(np.std(price_array))
print(np.sum(price_array))
print(np.max(price_array))

"""The functions above return the mean, standard deviation, total and maximum value of an array.

# Pandas
Pandas is one of the most powerful tools for dealing with financial data.

First we need to import Pandas:
"""

import pandas as pd

"""## Series
Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, float, Python object, etc.)

We create a Series by calling pd.Series(data), where data can be a dictionary, an array or just a scalar value.
"""

price = [143.73, 145.83, 143.68, 144.02, 143.5, 142.62]
s = pd.Series(price)
s

"""We can customize the indices of a new Series:"""

s = pd.Series(price,index = ['a','b','c','d','e','f'])
s

"""Or we can change the indices of an existing Series:"""

s.index = [6,5,4,3,2,1]
s

"""Series is like a list since it can be sliced by index:"""

print(s[1:])
print(s[:-2])

"""Series is also like a dictionary whose values can be set or fetched by index label:"""

print(s[4])
s[4] = 0
print(s)

"""Series can also have a name attribute, which will be used when we make up a Pandas DataFrame using several series."""

s = pd.Series(price, name = 'Apple Price List')
print(s)
print(s.name)

"""We can get the statistical summaries of a Series:"""

print(s.describe())

"""## Time Index
Pandas has a built-in function specifically for creating date indices: pd.date_range(). We use it to create a new index for our Series:
"""

time_index = pd.date_range('2017-01-01',periods = len(s),freq = 'D')
print(time_index)
s.index = time_index
print(s)

"""Series are usually accessed using the iloc[] and loc[] methods. iloc[] is used to access elements by integer index, and loc[] is used to access the index of the series.

iloc[] is necessary when the index of a series are integers, take our previous defined series as example:
"""

s.index = [6,5,4,3,2,1]
print(s)
print(s[1])

"""If we intended to take the second element of the series, we would make a mistake here, because the index are integers. In order to access to the element we want, we use iloc[] here:"""

print(s.iloc[1])

"""While working with time series data, we often use time as the index. Pandas provides us with various methods to access the data by time index"""

s.index = time_index
print(s['2017-01-03'])

"""We can even access to a range of dates:"""

print(s['2017-01-02':'2017-01-05'])

"""Series[] provides us a very flexible way to index data. We can add any condition in the square brackets:"""

print(s[s < np.mean(s)] )
print([(s > np.mean(s)) & (s < np.mean(s) + 1.64*np.std(s))])

"""As demonstrated, we can use logical operators like & (and), | (or) and ~ (not) to group multiple conditions.

# Summary
Here we have introduced NumPy and Pandas for scientific computing in Python. In the next chapter, we will dive into Pandas to learn resampling and manipulating Pandas DataFrame, which are commonly used in financial data analysis.

**_series.resample(freq)_** is a class called "DatetimeIndexResampler" which groups data in a Series object into regular time intervals. The argument "freq" determines the length of each interval.

**_series.resample.mean()_** is a complete statement that groups data into intervals, and then compute the mean of each interval. For example, if we want to aggregate the daily data into monthly data by mean:
"""

The **DataFrame** is the most commonly used data structure in Pandas. It is essentially a table, just like an Excel spreadsheet.

More precisely, a DataFrame is a collection of Series objects, each of which may contain different data types. A DataFrame can be created from various data types: dictionary, 2-D numpy.ndarray, a Series or another DataFrame.

df = pd.DataFrame(dict, index = data_index)

"""## Manipulating DataFrames
We can fetch values in a DataFrame by columns and index. Each column in a DataFrame is essentially a Pandas Series. We can fetch a column by square brackets: **df['column_name']**

If a column name contains no spaces, then we can also use df.column_name to fetch a column:
"""

df = aapl_table

As mentioned, all methods that apply to a Series can also be applied to a DataFrame. Here we add a new column to an existing DataFrame:
"""

aapl_bar['rate_return'] = aapl_bar.Close.pct_change()

We can also find the rows with missing values easily:

Hereby we introduced the most import part of python: resampling and DataFrame manipulation. We only introduced the most commonly used method in Financial data analysis. There are also many methods used in data mining, which are also beneficial. You can always check the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) official documentations for help.

# Colab Yahoo Graphical Representations of Data
By Evgenia "Jenny" Nitishinskaya, Maxwell Margenot, and Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie.

Part of the Quantopian Lecture Series:

* [www.quantopian.com/lectures](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures)
* [github.com/quantopian/research_public](https://github.com/quantopian/research_public)



Representing data graphically can be incredibly useful for learning how the data behaves and seeing potential structure or flaws. Care should be taken, as humans are incredibly good at seeing only evidence that confirms our beliefs, and visual data lends itself well to that. Plots are good to use when formulating a hypothesis, but should not be used to test a hypothesis.

We will go over some common plots here.
"""

# Import our libraries

# This is for numerical processing
import numpy as np
# This is the library most commonly used for plotting in Python.
# Notice how we import it 'as' plt, this enables us to type plt
# rather than the full string every time.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

!pip install yfinance

"""## Getting Some Data

If we're going to plot data we need some data to plot. We'll get the pricing data of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to use in our examples.

### Data Structure

Knowing the structure of your data is very important. Normally you'll have to do a ton of work molding your data into the form you need for testing. Quantopian has done a lot of cleaning on the data, but you still need to put it into the right shapes and formats for your purposes.

In this case the data will be returned as a pandas dataframe object. The rows are timestamps, and the columns are the two assets, AAPL and MSFT.
"""

import yfinance as yf

data_all = yf.download("AAPL,MSFT", start="2014-01-01", end="2015-01-01")
data_all.head()

data = data_all["Close"]
data.head()

data['MSFT'].head()

"""##Histogram

A histogram is a visualization of how frequent different values of data are. By displaying a frequency distribution using bars, it lets us quickly see where most of the observations are clustered. The height of each bar represents the number of observations that lie in each interval. You can think of a histogram as an empirical and discrete Probability Density Function (PDF).
"""

# Plot a histogram using 20 bins
plt.hist(data['MSFT'], bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Price')
plt.ylabel('Number of Days Observed')
plt.title('Frequency Distribution of MSFT Prices, 2014');

"""### Returns Histogram

In finance rarely will we look at the distribution of prices. The reason for this is that prices are non-stationary and move around a lot. For more info on non-stationarity please see [this lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity). Instead we will use daily returns. Let's try that now.
"""

# Remove the first element because percent change from nothing to something is NaN
R = data['MSFT'].pct_change()[1:]

# Plot a histogram using 20 bins
plt.hist(R, bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Return')
plt.ylabel('Number of Days Observed')
plt.title('Frequency Distribution of MSFT Returns, 2014');

"""The graph above shows, for example, that the daily returns of MSFT were above 0.03 on fewer than 5 days in 2014. Note that we are completely discarding the dates corresponding to these returns.

#####IMPORTANT: Note also that this does not imply that future returns will have the same distribution.

### Cumulative Histogram (Discrete Estimated CDF)

An alternative way to display the data would be using a cumulative distribution function, in which the height of a bar represents the number of observations that lie in that bin or in one of the previous ones. This graph is always nondecreasing since you cannot have a negative number of observations. The choice of graph depends on the information you are interested in.
"""

# Remove the first element because percent change from nothing to something is NaN
R = data['MSFT'].pct_change()[1:]

# Plot a histogram using 20 bins
plt.hist(R, bins=20, cumulative=True)
plt.xlabel('Return')
plt.ylabel('Number of Days Observed')
plt.title('Cumulative Distribution of MSFT Returns, 2014');

"""## Scatter plot

A scatter plot is useful for visualizing the relationship between two data sets. We use two data sets which have some sort of correspondence, such as the date on which the measurement was taken. Each point represents two corresponding values from the two data sets. However, we don't plot the date that the measurements were taken on.
"""

plt.scatter(data['MSFT'], data['AAPL'])
plt.xlabel('MSFT')
plt.ylabel('AAPL')
plt.title('Daily Prices in 2014');

R_msft = data['MSFT'].pct_change()[1:]
R_aapl = data['AAPL'].pct_change()[1:]

plt.scatter(R_msft, R_aapl)
plt.xlabel('MSFT')
plt.ylabel('AAPL')
plt.title('Daily Returns in 2014');

"""# Line graph

A line graph can be used when we want to track the development of the y value as the x value changes. For instance, when we are plotting the price of a stock, showing it as a line graph instead of just plotting the data points makes it easier to follow the price over time. This necessarily involves "connecting the dots" between the data points, which can mask out changes that happened between the time we took measurements.
"""

plt.plot(data['MSFT'])
plt.plot(data['AAPL'])
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(['MSFT', 'AAPL']);

# Remove the first element because percent change from nothing to something is NaN
R = data['MSFT'].pct_change()[1:]

plt.plot(R)
plt.ylabel('Return')
plt.title('MSFT Returns');

"""## Never Assume Conditions Hold

Again, whenever using plots to visualize data, do not assume you can test a hypothesis by looking at a graph. Also do not assume that because a distribution or trend used to be true, it is still true. In general much more sophisticated and careful validation is required to test whether models hold. Plots are mainly useful when initially deciding how your models should work.
